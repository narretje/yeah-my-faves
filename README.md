# yeah-my-faves
A collection of CSS styles that visually replace the fave button of Fediverse software with Miiverse's "Yeah!"

## Purpose
Make your Fediverse software (Akkoma, WAFRN, Mastodon etc.) much cooler by changing the look of your fave button to a Yeah! known from Nintendo's Miiverse.
This is... it.

## Usage
Depending on software you use, applying the CSS will differ.

### WAFRN
WAFRN has a theme editor which you can use to inject your style. The changes will be seen by other users on your profile.

### Akkoma
**As an user**: Use an userstyle browser extension to paste the code.  
**As an admin - with access to server files**: Paste the code into custom.css found in Akkoma's static directory.

**Software not listed above is not supported at the moment.**

## Contributions
You are welcome to contribute to the repository by adding your own CSS replacements or improving upon already existing ones.
Keep in mind that a complete CSS style eligible for this collection must contain:
- Styling for the "favorite" icon that hasn't been interacted with yet by the user (Yeah!)
- Styling for the "favorite" icon that has already been interacted with by the user (Nah...)

## Miscellanous
- For legalese reasons I am obliged to state that Miiverse belongs to Nintendo, and this repository isn't an attempt at any IP infringement. Let people have fun.
- I appreciate if you link back to this repository if you end up using any CSS from here in its entirety or majority. That's all.
